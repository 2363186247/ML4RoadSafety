# Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive collection of large-scale datasets for analyzing traffic accidents on road networks. The datasets consist of 9 million accident records gathered from 8 states across the United States.

### Features

- Diverse and extensive collection of traffic accident datasets
- Easy-to-use dataset loader for convenient data loading, fully compatible with the graph deep learning framework, [PyTorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- Example code scripts for training and evaluating graph neural networks on our datasets
- Detailed documentation on the data collection process using publicly available sources

### Installation

To use the traffic accidents dataset and its associated tools, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anonymous-researchcode/ML4RoadSafety.git
```

2. Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Quick Start: Package Usage

**TODOs**

- Write a dataloader for directly download the datasets
- Write the quick start instructions
- Sync to our anonymous link

**TODOs: @Abhinav**

- Please restructure the files under `./dataset_construction`
- Remove all the source files and link to our dataset url
- Write the README for different parts of the construction

### Data Collection Process

We have meticulously documented our data collection process, providing valuable insights into how we processed accidents and road networks using publicly available sources. This information serves as a reference for researchers and practitioners interested in analyzing traffic accidents.
